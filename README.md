# Caffeine Applet for [COSMIC DE](https://system76.com/cosmic/)

A simple COSMIC applet that prevents your system from going idle by creating a systemd-inhibit lock session. Perfect for keeping your machine awake on demand!

## Features

- Toggle Caffeine: Click the applet's icon to enable or disable an inhibit session.
- Minimal: Only uses a tiny amount of memory and CPU.
- Built with COSMIC: Integrates into your cosmic desktop or panel.


## Installation

A [justfile](./justfile) is included by default for the [casey/just][just] command runner.

- `just` builds the application with the default `just build-release` recipe
- `just run` builds and runs the application
- `just install` installs the project into the system
- `just vendor` creates a vendored tarball
- `just build-vendored` compiles with vendored dependencies from that tarball
- `just check` runs clippy on the project to check for linter warnings
- `just check-json` can be used by IDEs that support LSP

## Translators

[Fluent][fluent] is used for localization of the software. Fluent's translation files are found in the [i18n directory](./i18n). New translations may copy the [English (en) localization](./i18n/en) of the project, rename `en` to the desired [ISO 639-1 language code][iso-codes], and then translations can be provided for each [message identifier][fluent-guide]. If no translation is necessary, the message may be omitted.

## Packaging

If packaging for a Linux distribution, vendor dependencies locally with the `vendor` rule, and build with the vendored sources using the `build-vendored` rule. When installing files, use the `rootdir` and `prefix` variables to change installation paths.

```sh
just vendor
just build-vendored
just rootdir=debian/caffeine-applet prefix=/usr install
```

It is recommended to build a source tarball with the vendored dependencies, which can typically be done by running `just vendor` on the host system before it enters the build environment.

## Developers

Developers should install [rustup][rustup] and configure their editor to use [rust-analyzer][rust-analyzer]. To improve compilation times, disable LTO in the release profile, install the [mold][mold] linker, and configure [sccache][sccache] for use with Rust. The [mold][mold] linker will only improve link times if LTO is disabled.

## Usage

Once the applet is running:
- Click the coffee-cup icon to toggle between awake (caffeine mode) and idle (normal).
A PID file (/tmp/caffeine-id.txt) is maintained to track the systemd-inhibit session.
- If the PID file already exists, it means a caffeine session is running (and you wonâ€™t be able to start a new one without stopping it first).
